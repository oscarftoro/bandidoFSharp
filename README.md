# Bandido for FSharp
Bandido is a library that partially implements Binary Decition Diagrams in FSharp based on what we currently know about the subject [0,1,2,3,4]. Graph based algorithms for boolean manipulation can be used to solve and efficiently represent boolean formulas. Bandido in FSharp is an attempt to implement the algorithms in a functional style. Use bandido library for FSharp at your own logical risk. Happy satisfiability!


## What is implemented
Make, Build, Apply and Restrict algorithms are currently implemented.
