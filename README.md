# Bandido for FSharp
Bandido is a library that partially implements Binary Decition Diagrams in FSharp based on what we currently know about the subject [0,1,2,3,4]. Graph based algorithms for boolean manipulation can be used to solve and efficiently represent boolean formulas. Bandido in FSharp is an attempt to implement the algorithms in a functional style. Use bandido library for FSharp at your own logical risk. Happy satisfiability!


## What is implemented
Make, Build, Apply and Restrict algorithms are currently implemented. A rudimentary visualisation capability is 
also available. Given a table t : u -> (i,l,h) [3], the function Plot.t2dot t will translate the table into a dot graph that can be
compiled into a picture. Several cases of use are showed in Script.fsx and a set of tests are implemented in the Test folder.

## Build
The project requires dotnet core 2.0.

To compile, ensure to be placed into the src/ROBDD folder and type into the console:


```bash
dotnet build
```

to test, go to the Test folder and execute:
```bash
dotnet test
```
## TODO
